### Description of Features Developed

  - #### Below are the Features developed as part of the Core Sprint:

##### Feature 1\# US 4221: Setting up of a Cluster Time schedule:

  - Admin can set up a Cluster TS by enabling the Cluster flag. All
    cluster related fields are populated which can be filled to address
    the task in hand.

  - Different Intervals of OMLs permitted, this can be activated by
    enabling the “Different Intervals in Cluster” flag. This option is
    available in “MT Maritime Setup”

  - System wide usable checklist can be created in the “Checklist Tasks”
    page.

  - Required feedback checklists can be assigned in the Time schedule
    Texts.

  - In MT Maritime Setup the Default cluster checklists can be set up to
    be used with all Cluster WO.

  - Admin can now link multiple OML in the Cluster TS, these OMLs can
    have their own intervals and start dates.

  - Common Work plan can be assigned during the setting up of Cluster
    TS.

  - Set Next Action at can be defined at the OML

  - Partial/Full method of WO creation can be defined at the TS.

  - Individual OMLS can be set to block to skip appearing in the future
    WO.

  - Individual OMLs can also be removed by the admin.

  - Cluster TS can be blocked to stop generation of WO on that task.

##### Feature 2\# US 4222: Generation of a Cluster Work order from a Cluster Time Schedule

  - Cluster WO is generated, and the due date is based on the earliest
    OML’s due date.

  - As per the setting in “Set Next Action” the WO is generated either
    after completion of WO or at Fixed Intervals (whichever is set)

  - Based on the “WO Generation Method” (Full or Partial) the next WO is
    created either on completion of all items or after completion any
    item.

##### Feature 3\# US 4226: Reporting of a Cluster Work order

  - Cluster Reporting screen introduced in the WO reporting wizard.

  - Individual feed back as well as bulk apply of feed back is now
    possible in the same page.

  - Feedback can be in any format like checklist/text etc.

  - A follow-up WO can be triggered from the list.

### Description Of Features Developed

#### Feature 1\# DevOps ID 639: Provision for Sub-Components to inherit the incremental value from Main Component with a physical counter.

**Mapping and working of Associated counters - **

  - The admin will now have the provision to set up inheritance of 
    Counters of sub components with counters of the main component. In
    order to do that, 
    
      - The main component must have an Object Monitoring Line of type
        Counter, where the ‘Service Life’ is indicated as Yes. The sub
        component will have its own Object Monitoring Line of type
        Counter, and ‘Service Life’ indicated as Yes.
    
      - The Object Monitoring of Sub Component (associated counter) will
        only inherit the increment value and not the actual value of the
        main component. The Associated counter will have its own value.

<!-- end list -->

  - If the inheritance is setup , then the  user will not be able to
    update the counter of a sub component that is mapped to a main
    component as the counter will be dependent on the main components
    counter. 

  - The increment in the hours of the associated counter will be based
    on the main component counter. However, the sub component will be
    able to maintain its own counter value.

  - The Total value of the Associated Counter is the Counter value at
    the time of Bound + the number of hours the Main counter has run
    after Bound.

**Viewing of Associated Counters **

  - All the main components that have associated components are
    highlighted in bold in the update counter screen. 

  - By clicking on “process” of the main components, the user will be
    able to see the list of all the sub components that are linked to
    the selected main component. 

  - The Actual value and the total value of the main component is shown
    in two different columns 

  - The counter, daily average and the due date of the sub component is
    displayed separately from its main component.  

  - The counter of the sub component (associated counters) is view mode
    only. No provision to update the counter. 

**Work Order for Sub components**

  - Time schedules will be set as per the associated counters and not by
    the main components counter. For example - 

> Component ‘ME Piston with Piston Rod 1’ has a Time schedule called ‘ME
> Piston Overhaul’ at **16000** hours Interval.
> 
> ‘ME Piston with Piston Rod 1’ has a Counter -- which Inherits the
> increments from the Main Engine Counter. 
> 
> *Total Value* of <span class="underline">ME Piston with Piston Rod
> 1</span> = **5000**   
> *Total Value* of <span class="underline">Main Engine</span>  = 50,000
> 
> In the OML of the ‘ME Piston Overhaul’ Timeschedule, the Next Action
> by Value is ** 5000+ 16000 = 21000**
> 
> And the work order generated will have a Due Counter Value of
> **21,000.**

#### Feature 2\# DevOps ID: 651 & 652: Ability to Reset the Actual Counter without impacting the Total Running hours of the Main-Component or Sub-Components

**Reset of Main Counters **

  - In the update counter screen where the user can see the list of all
    main components, the counter values are displayed in two columns;
    “Actual  value” and “Total value”. When the user(with CE rights)
    will select the component that needs to be reset, the actual value
    of the component will change to zero or to any number user observes.
    However the total value will remain unchanged and have no impact.

  - Please note: The reset of the actual value of the main component
    will have no effect on its sub component and its associated
    counters.

  - After the physical counter is reset, the date &  value when the
    reset is done will be manually provided by the user to complete the
    process.

#### Feature 3\# DevOps ID: 2654: ‘Item Locations’ factbox available in Item Card.

Item Locations fact box & Item Locations List page shows **Location Code
|  Location Name | ROB** for all locations with ROB. To open the list
view a link has been provided in the title of Factbox.

### Description Of Features Developed

#### Feature 1: DevOps ID 965: WO Feedback Can Be Made Mandatory:

By enabling the feature “Mandatory of WO Done Feedback” in “MT Maritime
Setup” we can make WO done feedback mandatory system-wide. Under such a
circumstance the user won't be able to proceed to the next screen
without putting feedback.

#### Feature 2: DevOps ID: 2970: Deferment on counter-based work order:

  - Due counter is displayed in the "Deferment to counter value" field.

  - Below validations added to "Deferment to counter value" field
    
      - New value cannot be less than current counter
    
      - New value cannot be less than due counter

<!-- end list -->

  - "New Due Date" is calculating based on the below formula
    
      - Due Date + (Proposed Counter Value - Due Counter Value/Daily
        Avg)

  - Deviation percentage for counter-based jobs changed to:
    
      - Proposed Counter Value - Due Counter Value/Interval\*100

  - Disabled "New Due Date" for counter-based jobs and will update
    whenever the user changes the "Deferment to counter value".

#### Feature 3: DevOps ID 3737: Reporting of work orders when the consumption toggle is ON

  - Case 1: Item, Resource and Ext service consumption not entered.

<!-- end list -->

  - The system will show the message - "Consumption values not entered.
    Please update." Without filling the mandatory fields, the user won’t
    be able to report the work order.

<!-- end list -->

  - Case 2: If Resource and/or Ext service consumption is entered and
    Item consumption not entered.

<!-- end list -->

  - The system will show the message - "Item Consumption values not
    entered. Do you want to proceed?". If selected “Ok” then the user
    can proceed to report the work order.

<!-- end list -->

  - Case 3: If Item consumption entered, Resource and/or Ext service
    consumption not entered.

<!-- end list -->

  - No message will be shown. The user can proceed and report the work
    order.

#### Feature 4: DevOps ID 3739: Reporting of counter-based work order

  - The user will be prompted to update the counter as on date before
    reporting the work order.

#### Feature 5: Work Order screen changes: 

  - Two new columns have been added to the work order history screen;
    “Reported by Name” & “Reported by Rank”. Note: For newly closed
    work orders this is populated. For closed work orders migrated from
    AMOS, this information is yet to be migrated.

  - Work Order plan no. is introduced in report work order card

  - “Reminder Days” & “Reminder Counter Value” added to the work order
    card

  - the 'no. of Entries' has been modified as  'Consumption' in All Work
    orders & History fact box sections.

#### Observations :

1.  Currently all work orders are of type ‘Report Finished at’ . The
    work orders in AMOS that are of type ‘Fixed’ are also of type
    ‘Report Finished at’. The ‘Fixed’ date functionality will be
    handled in the upcoming sprints.

2.  Posting value through Item Journal for unmapped location in “
    Inventory Posting Setup” will cause error, as the location has to be
    first setup in the ‘Inventory Posting Setup.

Process

( Select the Entry Type in Item journal-\> Document No. will be auto
generated -\> select the Item-\> select the Location - \> Enter the Qty
- \> Select the Reason-\> Post the value )

Note : Inventory transactions are only allowed for Locations mapped in
the Inventory Posting Setup.

3.  Daily Average calculation , uses the 1st reading date and the
    corresponding counter value, if bound date of the component and the
    first reading date does not match.

Process

( Bound the new component in the system-\> Enter the Bound Date as
“Reading Date” and Counter value at the time of Bound as “Actual
value” Counter Update Screen -\> Post )

Note : If the counter value at the time of Bound is not available, the
average will be based on earliest counter reading and value available.

4.  Following Components, Last Reported Date is adjusted to 1 more date
    for the same counter values as specified in AMOS in order to Refresh
    Daily Average calculation

However, when the next new company is created, the Reading dates will
match with AMOS

### Description Of Features Developed

#### Feature \#1: WO Reporting wizard 

  - Work done feedback can be made mandatory for all work orders (Setup
    under Work order ‘MT Maritime Setup’)

  - When selecting items for consumption in the work order wizard, by
    default the spares of the component are listed. If required the
    ‘Advanced view’ can be used to expand the selection to stores and
    other spares. The MakerRef, Spare Maker, ROB details are available
    when selecting an item

  - While consuming items in the work order wizard, Location code and
    Location name of the item will be displayed in the wizard

  - Upon selecting an item to consume, all locations where ROB\>0 for
    this item is listed, for a user to select.

  - The current Counter value of the component is displayed on the last
    page of the wizard.

  - Header at every screen of the wizard, includes the Work order title,
    Technical Object No., Technical Object description and title of the
    page.

#### Feature \#2 :The default location in Item Card and Item Listing screen

  - In the Item Listing screen, default location name is visible against
    each item

  - In Item Card -\> Default location name field has been introduced
    under the Inventory section

  - Location code and the Name has been introduced in the below screens,
    
      - Item Card
    
      - Item Ledger Entries,
    
      - Work order Ledger Entries,
    
      - Work order reporting wizard: Consumption Screen
    
      - Work order Planning Lines in the Work order card

  - In the inventory setup, new toggle button is available to mark Item
    location mandatory and is set to be mandatory by default

  - Item description will be displayed in the Item Ledger Entry screens,
    and user can able to filter the same in the Ledgers

#### Feature \## 3: Work Order History

In the work order History, No. of Overdue Days column will be visible
and calculated based on the below calculation

Finished date \< Due date: No. of Overdue days = 0

Finished date \> Due date: No of Overdue days = No. of days between
Finished Date and Due Date.

It is possible to filter this column.

#### Feature \#4: Deferment request screen

  - Next action at Value will be available in the deferment request
    screen, user can easily know the action at value while requesting
    deferment

Deviation % calculation is corrected. Formula as per below :

Calendar based work orders :

Deferment Deviation % = \[(New Due Date - Due Date ) / Interval \] \*
100

Counter based work order s:

Deferment Deviation % = \[(Deferment to Value- Action at counter value)/
Interval\] \* 100

Note : For counter based Work orders, the New due date is first
calculated from the ‘Defer to Counter Value’, and the daily average of
the component counter, and the above formula is used for calculating the
Deviation %.

#### Feature \#5: Role center and Menu changes:

  - New sub-menu Items Ledger Entries has been introduced under
    Inventory main menu 

  - ‘Create Item journal entry’ option will be available in the role
    center

  - Maker and Model Column has been introduced in Component Listing
    Screen

    spare details in the item card

  - Reason column has been introduced in the Item journal screen and
    same displayed in Item Ledger Entries

  - Work order Priority Code introduced in Work order Card and Work
    order Listing screen.

  - All Tiles to say "WO" instead of "Work Order" to bring consistency
    and readability

  - Component Card -\> ‘Sparepart List’ factbox now displays the ROB of
    the spares

#### Feature \#6: Daily Average Calculation 

Daily average calculation for the component is calculated and displayed
in the update counter screen based on the below formula

Formula:

Daily Avg Hrs = Total Value \[Reported\] - Value at the time of first
reading  
No. of days

No. of days = First Reading Date to Last Reading Date

#### Feature \#7 ( Updated : Release 1.1)

Due date of Periodic work orders:

For Calendar based work order*: *

Due date = Last done date + Interval 

Note: Due date stays constant.

For Counter based work orders:

Due Date =   Reading Date - (Overdue Counter value / Daily Average) 

  Overdue Counter value = Current Counter value - Due Counter value

Note: Due date gets recalculated every time a counter update is done.
‘Reading date’ refers to the latest reading date of the counter value,
as displayed in the Counter update screen.

Due Date calculation for a newly bound component:

When a component has '0' counter value and the first work order will be
generated with due date as a default date of "31/12/2099" for all such
periodic work orders, as there is no daily average at the start.

  - After First Counter value is entered

            Due Date = Reading Date + (Interval / Daily Average)  

Note: For the subsequent work orders the due date is calculated based on
the new daily average, using the formula -\> Due Date = Reading Date -
(Overdue counter value / Daily Average) 

\*\* Note: Reading Date always refers to the latest reading date at
which counter value was recorded.
