## Description Of Features Developed

### Features developed as part of the Core Sprint:

#### Feature 1\# DevOps ID 639: Provision for Sub-Components to inherit the incremental value from Main Component with a physical counter.

**Mapping and working of Associated counters - **

- The admin will now have the provision to set up inheritance of 
    Counters of sub components with counters of the main component. In
    order to do that, 
    
    - The main component must have an Object Monitoring Line of type
        Counter, where the ‘Service Life’ is indicated as Yes. The sub
        component will have its own Object Monitoring Line of type
        Counter, and ‘Service Life’ indicated as Yes.
    
    - The Object Monitoring of Sub Component (associated counter) will
        only inherit the increment value and not the actual value of the
        main component. The Associated counter will have its own value.

<!-- end list -->

- If the inheritance is setup , then the  user will not be able to
    update the counter of a sub component that is mapped to a main
    component as the counter will be dependent on the main components
    counter. 

- The increment in the hours of the associated counter will be based
    on the main component counter. However, the sub component will be
    able to maintain its own counter value.

- The Total value of the Associated Counter is the Counter value at
    the time of Bound + the number of hours the Main counter has run
    after Bound.

**Viewing of Associated Counters **

- All the main components that have associated components are
    highlighted in bold in the update counter screen. 

- By clicking on “process” of the main components, the user will be
    able to see the list of all the sub components that are linked to
    the selected main component. 

- The Actual value and the total value of the main component is shown
    in two different columns 

- The counter, daily average and the due date of the sub component is
    displayed separately from its main component.  

- The counter of the sub component (associated counters) is view mode
    only. No provision to update the counter. 

**Work Order for Sub components**

- Time schedules will be set as per the associated counters and not by
    the main components counter. For example - 

> Component ‘ME Piston with Piston Rod 1’ has a Time schedule called ‘ME
> Piston Overhaul’ at **16000** hours Interval.
> 
> ‘ME Piston with Piston Rod 1’ has a Counter -- which Inherits the
> increments from the Main Engine Counter. 
> 
> *Total Value* of <span class="underline">ME Piston with Piston Rod
> 1</span> = **5000**   
> *Total Value* of <span class="underline">Main Engine</span>  = 50,000
> 
> In the OML of the ‘ME Piston Overhaul’ Timeschedule, the Next Action
> by Value is ** 5000+ 16000 = 21000**
> 
> And the work order generated will have a Due Counter Value of
> **21,000.**

#### Feature 2\# DevOps ID: 651 & 652: Ability to Reset the Actual Counter without impacting the Total Running hours of the Main-Component or Sub-Components

**Reset of Main Counters **

- In the update counter screen where the user can see the list of all
    main components, the counter values are displayed in two columns;
    “Actual  value” and “Total value”. When the user(with CE rights)
    will select the component that needs to be reset, the actual value
    of the component will change to zero or to any number user observes.
    However the total value will remain unchanged and have no impact.

- Please note: The reset of the actual value of the main component
    will have no effect on its sub component and its associated
    counters.

- After the physical counter is reset, the date &  value when the
    reset is done will be manually provided by the user to complete the
    process.

#### Feature 3\# DevOps ID: 2654: ‘Item Locations’ factbox available in Item Card.

Item Locations fact box & Item Locations List page shows **Location Code
|  Location Name | ROB** for all locations with ROB. To open the list
view a link has been provided in the title of Factbox.
