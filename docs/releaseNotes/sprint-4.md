## Description of Features Developed

### Features developed as part of the Core Sprint:

#### Feature 1\# US 4221: Setting up of a Cluster Time schedule:

- Admin can set up a Cluster TS by enabling the Cluster flag. All
    cluster related fields are populated which can be filled to address
    the task in hand.

- Different Intervals of OMLs permitted, this can be activated by
    enabling the “Different Intervals in Cluster” flag. This option is
    available in “MT Maritime Setup”

- System wide usable checklist can be created in the “Checklist Tasks”
    page.

- Required feedback checklists can be assigned in the Time schedule
    Texts.

- In MT Maritime Setup the Default cluster checklists can be set up to
    be used with all Cluster WO.

- Admin can now link multiple OML in the Cluster TS, these OMLs can
    have their own intervals and start dates.

- Common Work plan can be assigned during the setting up of Cluster
    TS.

- Set Next Action at can be defined at the OML

- Partial/Full method of WO creation can be defined at the TS.

- Individual OMLS can be set to block to skip appearing in the future
    WO.

- Individual OMLs can also be removed by the admin.

- Cluster TS can be blocked to stop generation of WO on that task.

#### Feature 2\# US 4222: Generation of a Cluster Work order from a Cluster Time Schedule

- Cluster WO is generated, and the due date is based on the earliest
    OML’s due date.

- As per the setting in “Set Next Action” the WO is generated either
    after completion of WO or at Fixed Intervals (whichever is set)

- Based on the “WO Generation Method” (Full or Partial) the next WO is
    created either on completion of all items or after completion any
    item.

#### Feature 3\# US 4226: Reporting of a Cluster Work order

- Cluster Reporting screen introduced in the WO reporting wizard.

- Individual feed back as well as bulk apply of feed back is now
    possible in the same page.

- Feedback can be in any format like checklist/text etc.

- A follow-up WO can be triggered from the list.
