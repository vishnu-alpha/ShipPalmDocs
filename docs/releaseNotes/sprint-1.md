### Observations :

1.  Currently all work orders are of type ‘Report Finished at’ . The
    work orders in AMOS that are of type ‘Fixed’ are also of type
    ‘Report Finished at’. The ‘Fixed’ date functionality will be
    handled in the upcoming sprints.

2.  Posting value through Item Journal for unmapped location in “
    Inventory Posting Setup” will cause error, as the location has to be
    first setup in the ‘Inventory Posting Setup.

Process

( Select the Entry Type in Item journal-\> Document No. will be auto
generated -\> select the Item-\> select the Location - \> Enter the Qty
- \> Select the Reason-\> Post the value )

Note : Inventory transactions are only allowed for Locations mapped in
the Inventory Posting Setup.

3.  Daily Average calculation , uses the 1st reading date and the
    corresponding counter value, if bound date of the component and the
    first reading date does not match.

Process

( Bound the new component in the system-\> Enter the Bound Date as
“Reading Date” and Counter value at the time of Bound as “Actual
value” Counter Update Screen -\> Post )

Note : If the counter value at the time of Bound is not available, the
average will be based on earliest counter reading and value available.

4.  Last Reported Date is adjusted to 1 more date for the same counter
    values as specified in AMOS in order to Refresh Daily Average
    calculation

## Description Of Features Developed
### Features developed as part of the Core Sprint/UAT:

#### Feature \#1: WO Reporting wizard 

- Work done feedback can be made mandatory for all work orders (Setup
    under Work order ‘MT Maritime Setup’)

- When selecting items for consumption in the work order wizard, by
    default the spares of the component are listed. If required the
    ‘Advanced view’ can be used to expand the selection to stores and
    other spares. The MakerRef, Spare Maker, ROB details are available
    when selecting an item

- While consuming items in the work order wizard, Location code and
    Location name of the item will be displayed in the wizard

- Upon selecting an item to consume, all locations where ROB\>0 for
    this item is listed, for a user to select.

- The current Counter value of the component is displayed on the last
    page of the wizard.

- Header at every screen of the wizard, includes the Work order title,
    Technical Object No., Technical Object description and title of the
    page.

#### Feature \#2 :The default location in Item Card and Item Listing screen

- In the Item Listing screen, default location name is visible against
    each item

- In Item Card -\> Default location name field has been introduced
    under the Inventory section

- Location code and the Name has been introduced in the below screens,
    
    - Item Card
    
    - Item Ledger Entries,
    
    - Work order Ledger Entries,
    
    - Work order reporting wizard: Consumption Screen
    
    - Work order Planning Lines in the Work order card

- In the inventory setup, new toggle button is available to mark Item
    location mandatory and is set to be mandatory by default

- Item description will be displayed in the Item Ledger Entry screens,
    and user can able to filter the same in the Ledgers

#### Feature \# 3: Work Order History

In the work order History, No. of Overdue Days column will be visible
and calculated based on the below calculation

Finished date \< Due date: No. of Overdue days = 0

Finished date \> Due date: No of Overdue days = No. of days between
Finished Date and Due Date.

It is possible to filter this column.

#### Feature \#4: Deferment request screen

- Next action at Value will be available in the deferment request
    screen, user can easily know the action at value while requesting
    deferment

Deviation % calculation is corrected. Formula as per below :

Calendar based work orders :

Deferment Deviation % = \[(New Due Date - Due Date ) / Interval \] \*
100

Counter based work order s:

Deferment Deviation % = \[(Deferment to Value- Action at counter value)/
Interval\] \* 100

Note : For counter based Work orders, the New due date is first
calculated from the ‘Defer to Counter Value’, and the daily average of
the component counter, and the above formula is used for calculating the
Deviation %.

#### Feature \#5: Role center and Menu changes:

- New sub-menu Items Ledger Entries has been introduced under
    Inventory main menu 

- ‘Create Item journal entry’ option will be available in the role
    center

- Maker and Model Column has been introduced in Component Listing
    Screen

- Maker Ref. Column has been introduced in the Item listing and under
    spare details in the item card

- Reason column has been introduced in the Item journal screen and
    same displayed in Item Ledger Entries

- Work order Priority Code introduced in Work order Card and Work
    order Listing screen.

- All Tiles to say "WO" instead of "Work Order" to bring consistency
    and readability

- Component Card -\> ‘Sparepart List’ factbox now displays the ROB of
    the spares

#### Feature \#6: Daily Average Calculation 

Daily average calculation for the component is calculated and displayed
in the update counter screen based on the below formula

Formula:

Daily Avg Hrs = Total Value \[Reported\] - Value at the time of first
reading  
No. of days

No. of days = First Reading Date to Last Reading Date

#### Feature \#7 ( Updated : Release 1.1)

Due date of Periodic work orders:

For Calendar based work order*: *

Due date = Last done date + Interval 

Note: Due date stays constant.

For Counter based work orders:

Due Date =   Reading Date - (Overdue Counter value / Daily Average) 

Overdue Counter value = Current Counter value - Due Counter value

Note: Due date gets recalculated every time a counter update is done.
‘Reading date’ refers to the latest reading date of the counter value,
as displayed in the Counter update screen.

Due Date calculation for a newly bound component:

When a component has '0' counter value and the first work order will be
generated with due date as a default date of "31/12/2099" for all such
periodic work orders, as there is no daily average at the start.

- After First Counter value is entered

Due Date = Reading Date + (Interval / Daily Average)  

Note: For the subsequent work orders the due date is calculated based on
the new daily average, using the formula -\> Due Date = Reading Date -
(Overdue counter value / Daily Average) 

\*\* Note: Reading Date always refers to the latest reading date at
which counter value was recorded.
