><p align="center"><Highlight color="#ebedf0">MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (MMS)</Highlight></p>
>
>The MMS module allows you to keep track of all the maintenance tasks scheduled for the vessel. The main purpose of this system is to ensure that all the maintenance activities for the ship is carried out at adequate intervals and on time so that the vessel always remains in good condition.
>
>MMS aligns the ship's machinery structures in a systematically arranged layout via Component Addresses and Mounting Positions. There are Time Schedules and Object Monitoring Lines available to schedule recurring maintenance tasks for these machineries. Furthermore, repair works carried out on these machineries can be generated as work orders. There are several other features available in the MMS, an overview of which has been discussed in this manual.


---

:::note

_When we say **MASTER DATA**, it involves creating machineries, categorizing them as Normal, Critical or CSM (Class Survey Machinery) components, setting up work plans, spares inventory and so on._

_Master data is created either based on machinery manuals, circulars issued by the manufacturers or relevant information shared by class or class approved authorities. The entries can either be created manually or by migrating the available data from other PMS software before the system goes live. During normal system operation, this data mostly remains unchanged and is changed only upon special requests made by the users upon approval by the shore technical team._

The component address represents the vessel and its various systems.
This enables the user to view the technical components in different
logical groups. It is the hierarchical arrangement of all the technical
components and is created by arranging the components in a parental
order i.e. each component address will be mapped to the next highest
component address.

The branches of this tree also include the mounting positions which act
as links between the component addresses and the technical components.

Mounting Positions are the locations at which the technical components
are placed or mounted. These mounting positions act as a link between
the Technical component and the Component Address. A mounting position
can be assigned to several component addresses and can be linked to one
technical component.

When the status of a Technical Component is "Installation", a mounting
position is assigned to a Technical Component and Start History is
clicked to start recording the ledger entries and capture the service
life of the component. Upon starting the history of a component, the
component assignment changes to mounted. At a later stage, if required
the technical component can be mounted or unmounted from the Component
Listing screen at any point of time.

Address, Mounting Position and Technical Components are linked together.

![](/help/admin/image87.jpg)
![](/help/admin/image88.png)

## 13. Work Plans

Work plans include creating safety instructions and work notices which are used further in creating the Time schedules. The advantage of creating work plans is that whenever a change is to be carried out in Safety instructions or work notices for multiple time schedules, the task can be accomplished by making a change in the work plan instead of making changes in multiple time schedules.

### 13.1 Creating A Work Plan

:::warning
*A Work Plan cannot be deleted if it is linked to any time schedule.*
:::
## 14. Time Schedule

Time schedule is a template for creating periodic work orders and the interval for evaluating the work order will depend on the technical object connected to it. Every time a periodic work order is finished, the time schedule generates the new work order again based on the
interval set.

Furthermore, the time schedules can be used as templates for Object Monitoring Lines for component addresses, mounting positions and technical components. The time schedule utilizes **Object Monitoring Lines** for generating work order. Also, the work plans (instructions, notices, checklists) can be attached to the time schedule that will be available in the work order.

**Object monitoring lines** connect technical objects such as component addresses, mounting positions and technical components to Time Schedules (Intervals) which is used as a template to create work orders. In addition to monitoring dates, object monitoring lines can also be used to monitor counters, threshold values and wear and tear.

### 15.3 Setting Up of Cluster Work Orders

#### 15.3.1. Creating a Cluster Time Schedule

-   In the Time Schedule List page, click on 'New' to create a new time
    schedule.

-   Fill all the required Information like Title, Responsible Rank,
    Department, WO Category Code. The No. is an auto generated field.

-   Now enable the Cluster Flag to get the cluster related options:
    Cluster Starting Date, Cluster Interval, WO Generation Method.

    -   WO Generation can be Full / Partial

    -   Full option is chosen when the user needs to complete all the
        tasks in the WO inorder to 'Finish' a work order. This also
        means that only after finished all tasks a new work order is
        created.

    -   Partial option is chosen when the user needs to complete few of
        the tasks and can keep the WO open in respective state. This
        also measns that a new Work Order is created with finished task.
        In future as and when the remaining tasks are closed the tasks
        gets to the open WO. (provided the new WO is not set to status
        "in progress")

![](/help/admin/image121.png)

-   In addition to the above, Work plan is also required.

![](/help/admin/image122.png)

-   Work Order Posting Group also needs to be selected.

![](/help/admin/image123.png)

#### 15.3.2. Linking / Creating OML to the Cluster Time Schedule

-   Admin can link existing OML or create a new OML in the cluster Time
    Schedule.

![](/help/admin/image124.png)

While linking OML from TS Card. The steps are : Navigate \> Time
Schedule \> Object Monitoring Lines. This is the preferred method, its
easier to define the requirements. Below you can see the all the
required fields marded in red:

![](/help/admin/image125.png)

Admin can also attach a Cluster Time Time Schedule going from a
component card/list page. In order to achieve this the admin needs to
navigate to the object monitoring lines list or card page and create a
new entry the result of adding a new entry would look like below:

![](/help/admin/image126.png)

#### 15.3.3. Enabling Auto Creation of WO

By default the OML created will be in inactive mode. Care should be
taken to enable the two setting to automatically create WO. So as shown
in the picture below Automatic Creation to be on and Status to be
Activated.

![](/help/admin/image127.png)

### 15.4 De-activating any Periodic Work Orders

**METHOD 1:**

For de-activating the periodic work orders, follow as below:

-   Go to *Technical Component* listing screen and search the component.

![](/help/admin/image109.png)

-   Select the component, go to *Process\>\>Monitoring*

![](/help/admin/image110.png)

-   Select the *Template Code* and *Time Schedule No.*

![](/help/admin/image118.png)

-   Go to *Process\>\>Card* to open Object Monitoring Card

![](/help/admin/image119.png)

-   Under General Tab, update *Automatic Generation of Work Order* to No
    and select the status as *De*-*Activated.*

![](/help/admin/image128.png)

-   The screen gets auto saved. Calendar Based Work Orders will not

**METHOD 2:**

OML and Time Schedules can be set to Blocked Mode
![](/help/admin/image129.png)

![](/help/admin/image130.png)

By doing so the Block function takes over the current active status.
Thereby no WO is generated. If individual OMLs are blocked in a cluster,
only those entries are skiped during the generation of next WO. If the
Entire Cluster Time Schedule is set to blocked, no more new Cluster WO
will be generated.

## 16. Counters Configuration


### 16.1. Setting up counters

For running hour machineries, the counters need to be created and set. Once the setup is complete, the counters shall list down on the Counter Update screen for regular updating. All counter based work order linked

### 16.2. Setting Up of Counters for Main Component

In the technical component card. Under the Monitoring lines create a new OML card with the following configuration to start capturing counter values from the 'Update Counters' Screen.

-   'Set Next Action at' to be put for the calculation to be initiated
    and to forecast the next due date.

-   Template Code to set to SL as this takes the Service Life Counter
    value of he component.

-   Optionally Description can be put as Hours in order for the user to
    identify its meant for capturing hours from Update Counter Screen.

-   In the Counters section fill the frequency at which the counters
    needs to be updated, beyond the set value the counter will be shown
    in red (overdue) at the counter update screen.

:::note
Since this is the OML setup to capture counter values for the main
component we do not specify anything in the Inherit section of Counters.

#### 16.2.1 Linking any OML of Main Component to the Counter SL OML to inherit counter values and increments

While creating a new Counter based OML apply the following setting for
it to inherit counter updates from the main component:

-   Select the Template code as 10000001. (which means this not an SL
    OML and it is supposedly going to inherit values from another SL
    OML)

![](/help/admin/image135.png)

-   In the Counter section insert the Interval (in hours), Reminder (in
    hours). Select the Technical component from which it should inherit
    the counter updates from.

![](/help/admin/image136.png)

-   In the Inherit Increment Line No. Select the Hours SL OML which we
    created in section
    [21.2](#212-setting-up-of-counters-for-main-component), this will link
    and enable the counter updates to be passed on to the current OML.

### 16.3. Setting Up of Associated Counters for Sub-Components

To set up the SL OML for the sub-component we will be following the same way as mentioned in [21.2](#212-setting-up-of-counters-for-main-component) for the General Tab.

However, in the Counter tab, we would be inheriting the Increment
Counter Updates from the main-component. To achieve this select the
technical component from which we are going to inherit counter update.
Secondly select the SL OML of the Technical Component.

#### 16.3.1 Linking any OML of Sub Component to the Associated Counter SL OML to inherit counter values and increments

Associated counters can be set up for sub-components which are linked to
the main component with physical counters.

While creating a new Counter based OML apply the following setting for
it to inherit counter updates from the main component:

-   Select the Template code as 10000001. (which means this not an SL
    OML and it is supposedly going to inherit values from another SL
    OML)

![](/help/admin/image135.png)

-   In the Counter section, insert the Interval (in hours), Reminder (in
    hours). Select the Technical component , in our case this will be
    the Sub-Component which we set up in
    [16.3](#163-setting-up-of-associated-counters-for-sub-components) from
    which it should inherit the counter updates.

![](/help/admin/image136.png)

-   In the Inherit Increment Line No. Select the Hours SL OML which we
    created in section
    [16.3](#163-setting-up-of-associated-counters-for-sub-components), this
    will link and enable the counter updates to be passed on to the
    current OML.

![](/help/admin/image137.png)

Once the above steps are completed, we can check the Update Counter
Screen. There you will find the main component in bold font and when
opening the associated counters you will find all the linked
sub-components listed here.

## 17. Setting Up Technical Spreadsheet

Technical spreadsheets are the performance monitoring templates to monitor trends and spikes in performance of the machineries. The spreadsheets are linked against the technical components.

Technical Spreadsheets are setup in 3 steps: -

a)  Creating the Technical Spreadsheet

b)  Linking the spreadsheet to a component group

c)  Linking the technical group to the technical components.

### 17.1 Creating a Technical Spreadsheet

-   In the BLOB search, type *Technical Spreadsheets* and select the
    item from the list.
